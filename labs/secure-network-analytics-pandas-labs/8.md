# Wrap-Up
In this lab you have learned how to work with datasets with Python and Pandas. You have also learned how Cisco Secure Network Analtyics works in high-level. You have seen how to clean up data, how to filter and sort this to find top outliers. This is a extremely simplified version of how to algorithms of Secure Network Analtyics work, but it teaches you the basics of such technology, while teaching you Pandas at the same time!

Continue you education by checking out the [Cisco Secure Network Anayltics dev center](https://developer.cisco.com/stealthwatch/)!
