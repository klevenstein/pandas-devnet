# Introduction to the dataset and Pandas

In this section, you learn about the dataset that you use during this Learning Lab. You also get a brief introduction to Pandas.

## Dataset

The dataset that you use in this Learning Lab derives from a Cisco Secure Network Analytics flow search query export. Because Secure Network Analytics has a database with all transactions (flows) that happened in the network, you can perform precise search queries. This precision can be crucial during forensic research into cyber attacks.

For this Learning Lab, a flow search was performed without any filter parameters except for the chosen time windows (10 minutes). In the following Lab exercises, you use this unfiltered flow dataset to calculate some baselines using Pandas. These exercises teach you how to use Pandas and how the engine works. 

> *Note*: Cisco Secure Analytics uses a complex combination of baselining, anomaly detection, and other machine learning algorithms. This Lab is an extreme simplification for educational purposes. 

The exported dataset is similar to the following example:

```
...,
{
      "Start": "2021-05-11T03:40:03.000+0000",
      "Duration": "7hr 57min 56s",
      "Subject IP Address": "10.201.3.20",
      "Subject Port/Protocol": "50928/TCP",
      "Subject Host Groups": "Web Servers, End User Devices, Desktops, Atlanta, Sales and Marketing",
      "Subject Bytes": "424.39 M",
      "Application": "Xsan Filesystem",
      "Total Bytes": "848.77 M",
      "Peer IP Address": "10.201.1.51",
      "Peer Port/Protocol": "22609/TCP",
      "Peer Host Groups": "Web Servers, Atlanta",
      "Peer Bytes": "424.39 M",
      "Actions": ""
},
...
```

The following list explains the keys in more detail:

* **Start**: Starting date and time of the flow. For example, if you browse to a website, it is the moment that your device connects with HTTPS to the webserver.
* **Duration**: The duration of the flow.
* **Subject IP Address**: The IP address of the source or initiating device, such as a laptop.
* **Subject Port/Protocol**: The source port.
* **Subject Host Groups**: The group that the source device belongs to. Groups can be created by the admin and are used to calculate baselines. 
* **Subject Bytes**: The number of bytes that the source has sent.
* **Application**: The applications used, such as HTTPS.
* **Total Bytes**: Total number of bytes sent and received.
* **Peer IP Address**: The IP address of the destination or receiving device, such as a webserver.
* **Peer Port/Protocol**: The destination port.
* **Peer Host Groups**: The group that the receiving device belongs to. These devices are also often hosts on the internet. They cannot always be defined by the admin.
* **Peer Bytes**: The number of bytes that the destination has received.

## Python Pandas

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool that is built with the Python programming language. It is a common tool for working with datasets. 

Pandas is a software library that is written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software that is released under the three-clause BSD license. The name derives from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for datasets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals. Its name is a play on the phrase "Python data analysis" itself. Wes McKinney started building an early version of Pandas at AQR Capital while he was a researcher there from 2007 to 2010.

### Features

Pandas includes the following features:

* DataFrame objects for data manipulation with integrated indexing.
* Tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data structures and different file formats.
* Data alignment and integrated handling of missing data.
* Reshaping and pivoting of datasets.
* Label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large datasets.
* Data structure column insertion and deletion.
* Grouping by engine, which enables split-apply-combine operations on datasets.
* Dataset merging and joining.
* Hierarchical axis indexing, enabling you to work with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure.
* Time series-functionality, including date range generation, frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging.
* Data filtration.
* Critical code paths written in Cython or C.
