# Import the dataset with Python

In this exercise, you learn how to import a dataset with Python and how to create a DataFrame using Pandas. You also inspect the DataFrame using the built-in method `head()` and `tail()`.

## Writing the code

> *Note*: In the next part of this exercise, you will download a completed and executable `pandas_exercise.py` file. The steps in this exercise explain how you can write this file yourself and what each piece of code does. You can follow along and write your own code, or use the `pandas_exercise.py` file.


1. Import `pandas`. It is customary to shorten `pandas` to `pd`.

      ```python
      import pandas as pd
      ```

2. Next, the script reads the dataset file and converts it into a DataFrame. Pandas has a built-in method for reading CSV and JSON files. 

      ```python
      df = pd.read_json(abs_file_path_json) #json file
      df = pd.read_csv(abs_file_path_csv) #csv file
      ```

3. Finally, the script must inspect the DataFrame by looking at either the first or last five rows of the DataFrame:

    ```python
    df.head()
    df.tail()
    ```

## Working with the dataset

Now it's time to work with the dataset itself. Before you begin, clone the required files from GitHub. Open up a terminal window and execute the following commands:

```bash
      mkdir pandas-lab-devnet
      cd pandas-lab-devnet
      git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/security-pandas-assets.git
      cd security-pandas-assets
```

1. In your code editor, open the `pandas_exercise.py` file. This file includes prewritten functions to analyze the data. 

2. Uncomment these lines in the main function and delete the `#TODO `:

```python
      def main():
      # Hands-on excercise: import dataset with Python
            #TODO df = obtain_df_from_dict()
            #TODO print(df.head())
            #TODO print(df.tail())
```

The result should look like the following example:

```python
      def main():
      # Hands-on excercise: import dataset with Python
            df = obtain_df_from_dict()
            print(df.head())
            print(df.tail())
```

3. Save the file and return to your terminal window. Before you execute the Python file, create a Python virtual environment and install the required Pandas libraries:

```bash
      python3 -m venv PANDAS-VENV
      source PANDAS-VENV/bin/activate
      pip install pandas
      pip install numpy
      pip install matplotlib.pylab
```

4. You can now execute the file:

```bash
      python pandas_exercise.py
```

The output is similar to the following example. Review it carefully:
