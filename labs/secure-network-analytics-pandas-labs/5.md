# Calculate average bytes per flow

In the previous exercise, you imported a file and created a Pandas DataFrame. In this exercise, you calculate the average bytes per flow:

* Parse a pandas DataFrame.
* Change the `dtype` of a DataFrame column.
* Calculate the average of a DataFrame column.
* Use the built-in `apply()` method of Pandas.


## Writing the code

> *Note*: The steps in this exercise explain how you can write this file yourself and what each piece of code does. You can follow along and write your own code, or use the `pandas_exercise.py` file.

This DataFrame contains three columns showing the number of bytes per flow: 
* `Subject Bytes`: The number of bytes flowing from the _source_
* `Peer Bytes`: The numbers of bytes flowing from the _destination_
* `Total Bytes`: The total numbers of bytes flowing from the _source_ and the _destination_. The _dtype_ of these columns is _object_ but to compute averages, we must convert the dtype to a _numeric_ type, such as `int64`. 

1. Write a function that can convert a string to a numeric value. If there is a metric prefix, such as _K_ or _M_, then these can be converted to numerics as well.

```python
def text_to_num(text, missing_data = 0):
    letter_to_number_dict = {
        'K': 1000,
        'M': 1000000,
        'G': 1000000000
    }
    if not isinstance(text, str):
        # Non-strings and missing data will be returned as 0
        return missing_data
    elif '--' in text:
        return missing_data
    elif text[-1] in letter_to_number_dict:
        # separate out the K, M, or B
        num, letter = text[:-2], text[-1]
        return int(float(num) * letter_to_number_dict[letter])
    else:
        return float(text)
```

2. Apply this function to an entire column of the DataFrame using the built-in method `apply()`. 

    ```python
        df['Total Bytes'] =  df['Total Bytes'].apply(text_to_num)
    ```
3. After applying the `text_to_num()` function to the entire column, we replace the previous column with the new column. Now, all the strings are replaced with numeric values and are ready to use in calculations. 

4. Calculate the average bytes per flow. You can use a built-in method that can calculate the average of the entire column. 
    
    ```python
    df['Total Bytes'].mean()
    ```
For the average bytes per flow, we obtain an average of 589kB per flow. 

## Execute the script

1. Open `pandas_exercise.py` and uncomment the following lines in the `main()` function. 

```
    # Hands-on excercise: Calculate average bytes per flow
    #TODO df['Total Bytes'] =  df['Total Bytes'].apply(text_to_num)
    #TODO print(df['Total Bytes'].mean())
```

```
    # Hands-on excercise: Calculate average bytes per flow
    df['Total Bytes'] =  df['Total Bytes'].apply(text_to_num)
    print(df['Total Bytes'].mean())
```

2. Run the script again in your terminal window. 

```bash
      python pandas_exercise.py
```

Review the output. Does this make sense to you? What does this mean?
